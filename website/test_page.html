    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
    <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
    <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

            <p>As a non-technical co-founder for a food-tech startup, the University of Adelaide’s Tech eChallenge run by Grant Hull was a critical step for me, which got me started on actually building something for my business!</p>
            <p>The program gave me a great understanding of the logic, flow and work involved with app development. Grant’s delivery was highly engaging and inspirational, as his intimate knowledge (based on his own personal experiences) gave clear credibility to the educational content he delivered.</p>
            <p>I learned to adopt a range of tools that later helped me to communicate my vision and plan with my designers and app developers. This helped to reduce costs of development and gave me an appreciation and understanding of the process.</p>
            <p>The pitch training was also useful for learning how to refine and sell the best solution for the problem, by challenging us to think about the 'jobs to be done'.</p>

            <p>Club Clipsal Australia recently engaged the services from Grant from Enabled to educate, coach and train our board members through the transformation of a Digital world.</p>
            <p>Grant and his team at Enabled already support our business (Clipsal by Schneider Electric) within the digital space through the iCat app they have developed for our industry, the electrical contractors. Whilst we work on the continual development of this app inside the digital world we need to engage with our audience and help our customers understand and develop their business within the digital world.</p>
            <p>The presentation the team at Enabled developed, along with the passion and outstanding presentation skills of Grant helped challenge the way our customers think about business and their space within the social media (digital world). Grant’s engagement challenged us to think deeply about the reasons why social networks work, which helped our customers make strategic and educated decisions about how they market their business to gain more business.</p>
