                    In this fast-moving world, rather than focusing on solutions, we need new patterns of thought. Sustainable innovations are inherently problem-centric, so by articulating the problems your customers experience and solving them better than your competitors, you will consistently achieve more valuable outcomes.

                    <br/>
                    These talks and workshops are intended to introduce these new ways of thinking so that businesses aren't dependent on specific strategies or platforms.  We also share the tools and methods to uncover causal attributes, helping you gain an understanding of what actions to take and direction to travel.

                        As a non-technical co-founder for a food-tech startup, the University of Adelaide’s Tech eChallenge run by Grant Hull was a critical step for me. I learned to adopt a range of tools that later helped me to communicate my vision and plan with my designers and app developers. This helped to reduce costs of development and gave me an appreciation and understanding of the process.
                        <br><br>
                        The pitch training was also useful for learning how to refine and sell the best solution for the problem, by challenging us to think about the 'jobs to be done'.
