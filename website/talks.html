    <h1>Talks & Workshops</h1>
    <br/><br/><br/>
    <p>How are you making sense of this fast-moving world, when what worked in the past isn’t working now?</p>
    <p>The truth is: the problems of the past are not the same as the current problems, or those in the future. That means by the time you fully apply the “hacks” which are relevant to today’s technology, they will have become irrelevant as the paradigm shifts.</p>
    <b>The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.</b>
    <p id="sub-script">John Maynard Keynes</p>
    <p>This is where innovation is different from creativity and invention. Instead of focusing on solutions, successful innovations are inherently problem-centric. By articulating the problems your users experience and solving them better than your competitors, you have a better likelihood of consistently achieving successful outcomes.</p>
    <p>These talks and workshops are intended to introduce a new way of thinking so that you are not trapped into a specific platform.  We also share the tools and methods to uncover causal attributes, helping you gain an understanding of what actions to take and direction to travel. </p>

            <p>As a non-technical co-founder for a food-tech startup, the University of Adelaide’s Tech eChallenge run by Grant Hull was a critical step for me, which got me started on actually building something for my business!</p>
            <p>The program gave me a great understanding of the logic, flow and work involved with app development. Grant’s delivery was highly engaging and inspirational, as his intimate knowledge (based on his own personal experiences) gave clear credibility to the educational content he delivered.</p>
            <p>I learned to adopt a range of tools that later helped me to communicate my vision and plan with my designers and app developers. This helped to reduce costs of development and gave me an appreciation and understanding of the process.</p>
            <p>The pitch training was also useful for learning how to refine and sell the best solution for the problem, by challenging us to think about the 'jobs to be done'.</p>

He has a modern approach to learning and teaching and presents current thinking that serves to inspire and challenge. </p>
            <p>Enabled has been involved with the Australian eChallenge program and Tech eChallenge programs as sponsors, facilitators and mentors and have had a great response from participants who have enjoyed Grant's approach to product design and development and the innovation process. </p>
            <p>Grant has a great sense of humour and presents with passion, he is a creative problem solver who challenges assumptions and looks for new ways to create value for his clients.</p>

        <div id="targ_3">
            <p>Club Clipsal Australia recently engaged the services from Grant from Enabled to educate, coach and train our board members through the transformation of a Digital world.</p>
            <p>Grant and his team at Enabled already support our business (Clipsal by Schneider Electric) within the digital space through the iCat app they have developed for our industry, the electrical contractors. Whilst we work on the continual development of this app inside the digital world we need to engage with our audience and help our customers understand and develop their business within the digital world.</p>
            <p>The presentation the team at Enabled developed, along with the passion and outstanding presentation skills of Grant helped challenge the way our customers think about business and their space within the social media (digital world). Grant’s engagement challenged us to think deeply about the reasons why social networks work, which helped our customers make strategic and educated decisions about how they market their business to gain more business.</p>
