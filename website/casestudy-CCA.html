          <p>The Mixxit@Home kiosk and App is a Point Of Sales tool for Coca-Cola Amatil to expand their customers’ thoughts of what drinks to make at their next social occasion, with the side effect of expanding customers purchase of Coca-Cola Amatil range of spirits. </p>
          <p>The challenge for Coca-Cola Amatil was many drinkers didn't feel comfortable or knowledgeable enough to mix their own cocktails at home. Shopping the spirits category was already confusing and difficult to navigate, often with minimal visibility in-store. This resulted in shoppers sticking with their tried and tested favourites of beer, wine and base spirits. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-right">
          <p>Coca-Cola Amatil saw an opportunity to educate shoppers and in turn boost sales of both their soft drink and spirits portfolio. </p>
          <p><strong>The key objectives:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop a shopper driven solution to drive larger basket sizes for key retail partners </li>
            <li>Educate and give shoppers the confidence to make cocktails at home</li>
            <li>Increase visibility in-store</li>

        <div class="project-twocolumns">
          <div class="column-left">
            <p>The App went through a few separate phases with an increasing amount of pilot store locations with each revision. </p>
            <p>The final app implemented an interactive experience to the user, allowing customers to browse a catalogue of drinks they can make at home. Upon making a selection they can email these recipes to themselves or share on social networks. </p>
            <p>There was also a drinks wheel that when spun &ldquo;wheel of fortune style&rdquo; would randomly display drinks allowing a fun mode of discovery.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column-right">
            <p>The iPad content was entirely updatable by Coca-Cola Amatil staff via a web admin and also provided them the ability to remotely display pricing promotions and change promotion slides on the attractor screen making the specific to the individual stores the Kiosk was located in. </p>
            <p>The web administration also provided Coca-Cola Amatil live statistics which was important feedback on its success and a tool that was used to demonstrate effectiveness to the retailer. </p>

          <h3>Not only could the iPad perform the task of touch screen and 4G modem, it could also drive a larger screen.</h3>
          <div class="column-left">
            <p>When Enabled were brought into the Mixxit@Home project, Coca-Cola Amatil were working with Telstra to roll out expensive media PC and 4G modem solution for the Kiosks. </p>
            <p>Enabled immediately spotted an opportunity to simplify the technical requirements of the project encouraging them to consider the iPad as the Kiosk solution.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column-right">
            <p>Besides the appeal of the less costly integrated solution offered by the iPad, our rationale was that customers would have a higher affinity with the iPad than they would with the larger traditional touch screen kiosks. </p>
            <p>The final benefit was that not only could the iPad perform the task of touch screen and 3G modem, it could also drive the larger screen above the shelving with different content, in this case an attractor video.</p>
